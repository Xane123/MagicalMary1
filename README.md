# world-of-kirbycraft

This is the ZDoom-based game engine used to power World of Kirbycraft.

As with the engine it's based on, this can be compiled on Windows, Mac, and Linux using the tutorials availiable on ZDoom's wiki.

For example, compiling on Windows: http://zdoom.org/wiki/Compile_ZDoom_on_Windows

Official builds are compiled with Visual C++ 2005 for compatibility with old Windows versions but will also compile with newer versions.

World of Kirbycraft's source code, due to it being based on ZDoom, is under the same licenses as http://zdoom.org/wiki/License.
