# World of Kirbycraft

This is the ZDoom-based game engine used to power World of Kirbycraft.

As with the engine it's based on, this can be compiled on Windows, Mac, and Linux using the tutorials availiable on ZDoom's wiki.

For example, compiling on [Windows](http://zdoom.org/wiki/Compile_ZDoom_on_Windows) and [Linux](http://zdoom.org/wiki/Compile_ZDoom_on_Linux) 

ZDoom no longer supports compiling with Visual C++ 2005, so compiling for older Windows versions is no longer possible.

World of Kirbycraft's source code, due to it being based on ZDoom, is under the same licenses as http://zdoom.org/wiki/License.
