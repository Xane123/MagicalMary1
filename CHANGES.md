# Changes (for v1.95 or v2.0)
This is a list of any changes done to Mary's Magical Adventure since the last release. They will be included in the list of changes for the release when it happens.
## Bug-fixes
* The version number on the title screen was corrected to v1.9.
* Xane's claw now uses the *Animation3* inventory item instead of *Animation2*. Before this, enemies could be provoked like if Mary cried near them if Xane tried firing his claw.
## Major
* Health and jump height can be upgraded by picking up upgrade items for them, which are separate from weapon upgrade items.
* Mary's Hammer Slam attack behaves differently now; Instead of activating based on height alone, which could lead to unfair deaths, it now activates if at a high enough height **and** the attack button is held down. Briefly pressing the attack button will do the normal hammer attack now, even in mid-air!
## Minor
* Making it to the end of an area with more than 15 coins will automatically send them to the bank in the Small Hut, but some coins will be removed. Additionally, if transformed even less will be stored in the bank. This was done to encourage the player to warp to the Small Hut and add them to the bank manually, which could give them interest in buying things from its shop or trying out minigames. Those give the player a lot of coins if played well.
* Lovely Heart's big heart-shaped projectile isn't treated as a "powerful projectile" to enemies anymore. This was done so enemies like cops wouldn't jump over Magical Cutie Mary's attacks, which would waste the five coins it takes to perform the attack.
* Mary's "falling scream" sprites have been re-added into the game, but in the new art style.
