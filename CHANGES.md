## Bug-fixes
* The version number on the title screen was corrected to v1.9.
* Xane's claw now uses the *Animation3* inventory item instead of *Animation2*. Before this, enemies could be provoked like if Mary cried near them if Xane tried firing his claw.
## Major
* Health and jump height can be upgraded by picking up upgrade items for them, which are separate from weapon upgrade items.
