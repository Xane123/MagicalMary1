s# Changes (for v2.0)
This is a list of any changes done to Mary's Magical Adventure since the last release. They will be included in the list of changes for the release when it happens.
## Bug-fixes
* Disabled "HandleHealthEvents" script in the Small Hut, which fixes the player randomly dropping coins upon warping there for a second time after losing health in the level.
## Major
* Upgrades are now non-linear! When a player picks up a weapon upgrade, a menu appears; Choose an upgrade from this menu then you will be given it! You can't see upgrades for weapons you don't have on-hand, and the final, fourth upgrade for each weapon can only be chosen once all other upgrades for that weapon are activated.
* Each weapon must have four upgrades due to the new upgrade menu, so Mary's Umbrella now has a new upgrade, Charged Burst! When used, Mary holds her umbrella back. When released, Mary quickly hits the enemy up to five times, depending on how long it was held back.
* Soap Boxes can be bought from Jane's Shop in packs of four! You can hold up to sixteen of them and place them anywhere to try catching enemies off-guard.
## Minor
* Xane's thrown hammer now is affected by gravity. It has less gravity for a few split-seconds but falls quicker after that.
* Jane's Shop is now complete; The last two slots were filled by **Soap Box Ã—4** and **Ability Upgrade**!
* Friendly Turrets are now placed slightly closer to the player.
* Buffed Soap Boxes slightly; Soap that lands on the ground deals more damage over time and flies farther from the Soap Box. Additionally, Soap Boxes have less health, so a single hammer attack makes them explode now.
* Magical Cutie Mary isn't affected by cops' stunning bullets and other special pain reactions.
