# Changes (for v1.88)
This is a list of any changes done to Mary's Magical Adventure since the last release. They will be included in the list of changes for the release when it happens.
## Bug-fixes
* Xane's Claw is now more responsive, only requiring a single use to stick to the circular objects placed on walls.
* Fixed division by zero error if returning to an area from a Special Stage if a moving skybox is in use.
## Major
* Xane's claw now pulls Xane up to whatever's above the spot it attached to. This can be seen in 1-2 near the end of the area.
* Demos now use a CVAR (cl_demo) instead of using custom GameType checks. This increases compatibility with Delta Touch.
## Minor
* Mary's House is now correctly referred to when spawning in it initially. Before, it was called "Small Hut".
* A small area was added behind Jane in the Small Hut, which will be used for a later game mechanic.
