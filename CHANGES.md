# Changes (v1.86)
This is a list of any changes done to Mary's Magical Adventure since the last release. They will be included in the list of changes for the release when it happens.
## Bug-fixes
* The "Return to Hell City" and "Avoid Jail" glitches, which were in Mary's Magical Adventure for many versions, are now both fixed.
* If you fail a Special Stage then return to it through a second entrance in the same level, Mary/Xane won't become stuck in it.
* Attempting to visit a Special Stage when you have all of the Chaos Bridges through forcing it using the "changemap" CCMD will instantly kick you back out to the last level you were on.
* If the player tries to force themselves into a Special Stage they aren't currently on, they will be forced instantly onto the correct Special Stage. This isn't done if recording or playing back a demo, though.
## Miscellaneous
* Jane's Shop's "random upgrade" item now works as intended and gives Mary hammer and umbrella upgrades. It doesn't tell you what you get, though, an d I'm unsure what to do to make the tutorials appear as if Mary picked up an upgrade item.
* Downgraded Mary's front door to not use a camera texture as you couldn't see anything special happen outside it anyways.
