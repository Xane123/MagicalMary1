New variables being added to the source code/MAPINFO/GetLevelInfo:
Variable		LEVELINFO constant		Description
leveltype		LEVELINFO_TYPE			Level type - 0: Normal, 1: Special Stage, 2: Battle Arena, 3: Twisted Metal-like combat?
timeofday		LEVELINFO_TIMEOFDAY_ON	If non-zero, enables the time of day system. Number determines color/sky property set, like 1 = Peacewater.
override_time	LEVELINFO_NEXTMAP_TIME	Forces the time of day to this ID, given it's > -1. On levels where time of day's disabled, this sets the time of day that the next visited level will use.

TIME OF DAY REVIVAL?
The quickly-scrapped time-of-day system could be revived for new levels, minus those that use 3D skyboxes designed only for specific times of day (like the 3D river/Cumulus Peaks skies).
To make things more interesting, there should be more times implemented than just day, sunset, night, and sunrise...

0	Day
1	Early Sunset
2	Sunset
3	Late Sunset
4	Night
5	Early Sunrise
6	Sunrise
7	Late Sunrise

Just like when the time of day system was used, the cloudy sky and fog are special, and should probably be connected to the rain ambience's lightning flashes.
