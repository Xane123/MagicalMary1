New variables being added to the source code/MAPINFO/GetLevelInfo:

TIME OF DAY REVIVAL?
The quickly-scrapped time-of-day system could be revived for new levels, minus those that use 3D skyboxes designed only for specific times of day (like the 3D river/Cumulus Peaks skies).
To make things more interesting, there should be more times implemented than just day, sunset, night, and sunrise... Here's the list.
(Also, to force a given time of day to be used, edit the time of day global variable then call "ToD_ForceUpdate".

0	Day
1	Early Sunset
2	Sunset
3	Late Sunset
4	Night
5	Early Sunrise
6	Sunrise
7	Late Sunrise

Just like when the time of day system was used, the cloudy sky and fog are special, and should probably be connected to the rain ambience's lightning flashes.
